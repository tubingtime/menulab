## Background

MenuLab consists of two repositories:

1. Backend - menu-ab-api
2. Frontend - menu-ab-web

This repository is the backend. 

It contains the user authentication and authorization logic, CRUD APIs for creating and managing a menu, APIs for uploading and managing photos, and the schema for the postgreSQL database.

### Core Features
1. Register and login users

2. Create and manage a menu 
    - Create a new menu
    - Read a menu
    - Update a menu
    - Delete a menu

3. Create and manage a menu section
    - Create a new menu section
    - Read a menu section
    - Update a menu section
    - Delete a menu section

4. Create and manage a menu item
    - Create a new menu item
    - Read a menu item
    - Update a menu item
    - Delete a menu item

5. Upload/delete a photo

6. Generate a menu preview



<br />

## Install

1. Install postgreSQL.

2. Set up postgres database using the schema in database.sql. Not your username, password, host, postgres port, and database name.

Check that tables are correctly installed:
```
    List of relations
 Schema |        Name         | Type  |  Owner   
--------+---------------------+-------+----------
 public | items               | table | postgres
 public | menu_assignments    | table | postgres
 public | menus               | table | postgres
 public | section_assignments | table | postgres
 public | sections            | table | postgres
 public | users               | table | postgres
(6 rows)
```

3. Set up an Cloudinary account. Note your cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret.

4. Clone this repository and go to ```menu-ab-api/server```.

5. Install Postman for the purpose of testing backend.

6. Install dependencies: ```npm install``` OR ```npm i express cors pg jsonwebtoken bcrypt dotenv```. 

7. Create a file called `.env` in ```menu-ab-api/server``` with the following: 
    ```
    jwtSecret=YOUR_JWT_SECRET_HERE
    user=postgres
    password=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD_HERE
    host=YOUR_DATABASE_HERE
    postgresPort=YOUR_DATABASE_PORT
    database=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
    nodePort=YOUR_LOCAL_PORT
    cloud_name=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_NAME
    api_key=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_KEY
    api_secret=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_SECRET
    ```
8. Run.
    - Option 1: Run ```node index.js```.
    - Option 2: Install nodemon ```npm install -g nodemon``` and then run nodemon ```nodemon```.

## Database

This project uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). 

The database schema is located at ```/server/database.sql```. 

Here is an overview of the database schema:

<br />

## Known Bugs
- Backend validates most inputs. Frontend does not perform sufficient validation.
- JWTSecret should be a more complex token that changes more frequently.
- User tokens are complex but are currently set to change every X days instead of every time the user logs in. 
- There are possible security vulnerabilities in terms of our Amazon RDS server.

<br />

## Usage
To experiment as a test user (if using Amazon RDS database)
Test User:
- Name: ```test```
- Email: ```test@email.com```
- Password: ```test```
- UUID: ```9aafde03-6b1b-44a7-aa41-55339f5a1d3b```

1. Login with test credentials using Postman and get the user token (see jwtAuth.js for Login route).

2. Test any of the routes by going to jwtAuth.js or dashboard.js.

3. Test any of the APIs in dashboard.js.

4. Optional: Set up the menu-ab-web repository.

## Contributing

No contributions are accepted at this time.

Adding new components to the backend is simple.
1. Create a new branch such as ```feat/get_section_ids```.
2. Navigate to ```/server/routes/dashboard.js```.
3. Write a new API for the component that you would like to add ex. GET request for getting all the section ids.
4. Test the component in Postman.
5. Push your work to the repository and wait for review.
6. Once your code passes review, it can be merged into main.

<br />

## Future Work
- Create a backend API that allows the user to upload POS (Point of Sale data).
- Process POS data.
- Generate insights and recommendations based on POS data.
- Use DoorDash or UberEats APIs to connect menus created on these apps to menus created on MenuLab.
