## Background

MenuLab consists of two repositories:

1. Backend - [menu-ab-api](https://github.com/tubingtime/menu-ab-api)
2. Frontend - [menu-ab-web](https://github.com/tubingtime/menu-ab-web)

This repository is the frontend. 

It mostly consists of react components for the user interface. There is some code to handle the checking of user authentication and storing the JWT.

This diagram gives an overview of our technical architecture:

## Install

1. Clone the repository and go to ```menu-ab-web/client-next```

2. Install dependencies: ```npm install```. 

3. Create a file called `.env.local` in ```menu-ab-api/server``` with the following: 
    ```
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET = YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT = YOUR_API_PORT
    ```
8. Run: ```npm run dev```

<br />

## Usage
To experiment as a test user (if using Amazon RDS database)

Test User:
- Email: ```test@email.com```
- Password: ```test```

1. With the frontend and backend running, navigate to Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login

2. Login using the test user credentials

3. You will be redriected to the dashboard where you can navigate to the different pages, like the menu editor:

<br />

## Known Bugs
- Frontend does not perform sufficient validation.
- AssignTo requires a manual refresh.

## Sources

- We used this todo-list app tutorial to as a foundation for our frontend: 

    - Title: [Learn JWT with the PERN stack by building a Registration/Login system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vF0FGfa0RQ)


- Since this project is using NextJS 13, we followed [Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy), a notetaking app built using Next and React, as an example.



- For avoiding full page reloads, we followed React's official [state management documentation](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state).

## Contributing

No contributions accepted at this time. 

To add a new component to the frontend
1. Create a new branch such as ```feat/add-menus```.
2. Create a new file in the componenents directory ```/client-next/src/components/AddMenus.tsx```.
3. Write the React code for your component. If there's a similar component, copy that one and base your new one off of it. If your component needs to make API calls, you will need to get the user's JWT with `useToken()`.  If your component is making updates to shared state, such as the list of menus, you will need to use the dispatch function to tell React to update the state. See `AddMenu.tsx` for an example of how to do this.
4. Add your component to the page you want it on. If you wanted your component on the main dashboard page, navigate to ```/client-next/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx``` and add `<AddMenus />` in the return statement of the Dashboard function. If you want your component on a new page, add a new directory in the `/app` directory with your page's name. In youe new directory, add a `page.tsx` file with your React code. For more information on the `/app` directory, see the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-directory)
6. Run the app and test your component.
7. Create a pull request for your changes and wait for review.
8. Once your code passes review, it can be merged into main.

## Future Work
- Use drag and drop for moving menu items around to different sections and positions
- Have data visualization graphs reflect real POS data
- Choose what items you want to make a visualization for
- Use DoorDash or UberEats APIs to connect menus created on these apps to menus created on MenuLab.
- More custom styling
